## 🌐 Live Site

This is a personal handcrafted website, built entirely from my **iPhone XR** using **GitHub** — no desktop, no apps, and no converters.

## 🛠 How I Manage Code (In-Place on GitHub)

- I manage code and make edits **in-place** using GitHub’s mobile tools (in Safari on iPhone XR)
- I use GitHub’s **inline editor** (the pencil icon) for most content updates
- For video uploads:
  - I use GitHub’s **Record video** feature to upload 30-second clips
  - It saves the file with a long name like `1234567891234567.mov`
  - I open GitHub’s **dev editor** to rename the file to something like `clip1.mp4`
  - No video converter needed — just change `.mov` to `.mp4` and it works in the browser!

Everything is handled directly on my phone. No laptop or external apps needed.

## 🤔 Why Not Just Use a Laptop?

**Laptop? Nah, I prefer my pocket powerhouse.**  
Building this website on an iPhone XR isn’t just a challenge — it’s a statement.  
Who says you need a laptop to get stuff DONE? 😂🚀

## ✨ Site Features

- 🖼️ Photo carousel to showcase handmade wooden creations
- 📝 Blog cards linking to individual blog pages
- 🎬 30-second video clips recorded in real-time and embedded from GitHub
- 🛍️ A product gallery layout (see disclaimer below)
- 🌍 Custom domain via Namecheap

## 🧪 Video Upload Workflow

- **1080p setting** = 15 seconds max recording
- **720p setting** = 30 seconds max
- I use 720p so I can upload longer clips to GitHub

I record videos right inside GitHub and upload them directly. Just rename the file and it's good to go — plays perfectly on desktop and mobile browsers.

## 🛒 Products Page Disclaimer

> ⚠️ **This is a demo site. No products are for sale.**  
> The products, prices, and checkout buttons are for layout and design showcase only.  
> This site does **not process payments**, and no commercial transactions are being conducted.

This section is meant to demonstrate what a storefront *could* look like using only mobile tools — nothing here is connected to a real checkout.

## 💡 Why I Built This

To prove that you can build, design, and host a fully functional website **using only your phone** — no paid software, no fancy setup.

This project is about:
- Learning by doing
- Exploring mobile-only workflows
- Creating a real online presence for handmade art
- Sharing what's possible with just GitHub and a little creativity
