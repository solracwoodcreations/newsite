## 🌐 solracmidnightwoodcreations.com

Welcome to my personal handcrafted website, built entirely from my **iPhone XR** using **GitHub** — no desktop, no external apps, and no video converters.

📍 **Live site**: [https://solracmidnightwoodcreations.com](https://solracmidnightwoodcreations.com)

## ⚙️ How I Built This Website

This website is managed 100% from my phone — no laptop, no desktop. Everything is created, uploaded, edited, and updated using:

- **GitHub in Safari** on iPhone XR
- GitHub’s built-in file editor (inline and dev edit modes)
- GitHub's "Record video" upload feature

### 🎥 How I Upload Videos (Using Just My Phone)

- I use the “Record video” feature directly in GitHub
- The videos save as `.MOV` files
- I rename the extension to `.MP4` (no converter needed!)
- The videos play perfectly in browsers like Safari and Chrome

> 🔄 It’s a simple trick — renaming the file lets the browser treat it as a standard MP4

## 📷 What's on the Site

- 🖼️ A **photo carousel** to show off custom wood art
- 📝 **Blog cards** that link to full blog entries
- 🛍️ A **products page** with sample prices and layout (see disclaimer below)
- 🎬 30-second video clips showing wood pieces in action
- 🌐 A custom domain via Namecheap for just ~$11/year

---

## 🛠 How I Edit Everything on Mobile

I use two ways to edit files on GitHub:

### 1. Inline Edit (📝 Pencil Icon)
- Quick changes like renaming a file or tweaking text

### 2. Dev Edit
- Opens a better full-page editor in the browser
- Good for working with multiple files or making bigger changes

Everything happens right in Safari on my iPhone. No apps needed.

## 📏 Video Recording Limits

- 1080p = Max 15 seconds per clip
- 720p = Up to 30 seconds
- I use 720p to maximize video length within GitHub’s limits

## ⚠️ Disclaimer: This is a Demo Site

This website is a **personal design and development project**.  
The **products, prices, and checkout buttons** shown on the Products page are for **display only**.

> 🛑 **No products are for sale.**  
> 🛒 The checkout button does not lead to a real store.  
> 💻 This is not a commercial website.

This project is for learning, showcasing design layout, and demonstrating what’s possible using **GitHub + iPhone only**.

## 💡 Why I Built This

To prove you can build a fully functional and visually rich website:
- Without a laptop
- Without paid software
- With just a phone and a free GitHub account

It's also a great way to practice frontend design, mobile workflows, and content creation — all from your pocket.
