      <p>
        I’m <strong>Carlos Rodriguez</strong>, the hands and mind behind <strong>Opal Woodgrain</strong>. My journey isn’t typical — 20 years ago, I was in a car accident that should have ended my life. <strong>I died at the scene and was revived on the way to the hospital.</strong> I broke my back, collapsed my pelvis, crushed a lung, and suffered nerve damage in my left leg. Doctors told me I would never walk again. Yet here I am — walking, creating, and building a life I’m proud of.
      </p>

      <p>
        Those early years of recovery were harsh. I spent months in the hospital and wheelchair-bound, learning to move again. But during that time, I discovered something essential: even when life breaks you, you can rebuild — not just your body, but your purpose. That’s how woodworking found me.
      </p>

      <p>
        My first project was simple: a paper towel holder made from a broken bed frame. I left the staple scars visible, stained it with a warm walnut finish, and polished it to shine. That little piece taught me something I carry to this day: <em>wood, like life, can be repaired, repurposed, and reborn.</em> Every piece I make tells a story — of resilience, of patience, and of transformation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Opal Woodgrain</strong> isn’t about making objects that sit on shelves as paperweights. Every creation is <em>functional wood art</em>: a coffee shelf station, a key holder, a <strong>tobacco pipe</strong> — each designed to serve a purpose while reflecting beauty, craftsmanship, and intention. I approach every project with care, because art should live in your home and your life, not just on display.
      </p>

      <p>
        What I make is personal. I work with reclaimed wood, salvaged materials, and pieces that might otherwise be discarded. In each project, I see a reflection of my journey: broken, repaired, given a second chance, and turned into something meaningful.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve spent the past 20 years not just recovering, but learning to live fully — to embrace creativity, gratitude, and the simple joy of making something with my own hands. Through <strong>Opal Woodgrain</strong>, I invite you to experience more than furniture or decor. You’re seeing the story of survival, the beauty of functionality, and the soul of craftsmanship in every curve, edge, and finish.
      </p>

        This is my life. This is my art. This is <strong>Opal Woodgrain</strong>.
