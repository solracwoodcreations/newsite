    <main class="about-content">
        <p>My name is <strong>Carlos Rodriguez</strong>. Twenty years ago, I was in a car accident where I <strong>died at the scene</strong> and was revived on the way to the hospital due to a severe case of <strong>sleep apnea</strong>. The accident left me with a broken back, a collapsed pelvis, a crushed T12 vertebrae, a collapsed lung, and nerve damage in my left leg. Doctors told me I would never walk again. A year later, I was walking — not perfectly, but walking — and today, after 20 years, I move far better than anyone expected.</p>

        <p>For the past 15 years, I’ve been living with a unique challenge: I spend much more time asleep than awake. My sleep pattern often keeps me asleep for five hours, awake for three, and then asleep for four or five more hours, repeating for days, followed by a long crash of 14 hours of sleep. I experience extremely vivid, movie-like dreams, remembering every detail. Two weeks ago, I decided to reverse my sleep schedule, staying awake all day until 10 PM and gradually training my body to sleep at night and wake in the morning. It’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever done — even harder than learning to walk again after my accident — but I’m making progress, slowly reclaiming control over my body and mind.</p>

        <p>During my recovery from the accident, I started noticing old, broken, discarded pieces of wood. I realized that if I could be put back together and healed, surely I could repurpose wood and give it new life. My first project was a <strong>paper towel holder</strong> made from a broken bed frame. I left the staple scars visible, gave it a warm walnut stain and glossy finish, and for the first time, I felt the joy of creating something beautiful out of what had been broken. Every project I make is <strong>functional wood art</strong> — not a paperweight, but something to use and cherish.</p>

        <p>That first paper towel holder sparked a decade-long journey of woodworking, where every piece carries meaning, purpose, and connection. They are not just objects; they are stories, reflections of resilience, and the beauty of being repurposed and reborn.</p>

        <p>Years later, I wanted to <strong>showcase my functional wood art</strong> to the world. When I researched websites, I realized professional options were prohibitively expensive — hundreds of dollars — so I decided to take a completely different path: I would <strong>learn to code and build my own site</strong>. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript using YouTube tutorials, mostly copying and adapting examples. I did all of this on my <strong>iPhone XR</strong>, without a computer or laptop, and used GitHub to manage and publish my work. I even bought a domain name for just $11 and published the site online.</p>

        <p>For a year, the site existed as a personal project, a way to share my work and my journey. Now, under the new name <strong>Opal Woodgrain</strong>, I’m relaunching the website with tweaks to reflect me, my art, and my story. It’s still about the pieces themselves — functional wood art with purpose — but now it also reflects the determination and creativity that brought this website to life from scratch.</p>

        <p>Every piece I create, and every element of this website, is a reflection of who I am: a survivor, a creator, and someone who finds joy in building, repairing, and sharing beauty. This is why <strong>Opal Woodgrain exists</strong> — to honor resilience, creativity, and the artistry in both wood and life.</p>
