    There’s something deeply satisfying about giving new life to old wood — taking something forgotten and transforming it into a piece that’s both beautiful and useful. That’s exactly what I set out to do with this project: a <strong>wall-mounted coffee shelf station</strong>, made entirely from <strong>refurbished materials</strong> that were destined for the scrap pile.
  </p>
        <br>

  <p>
    This shelf actually began as part of a <strong>broken bedframe</strong>. Instead of throwing it away, I saw the potential hidden in the worn wood. I cut it down, sanded it smooth, and gave it a rich <strong>red mahogany stain</strong> that brought out its natural grain and warmth. What had once been a discarded piece of furniture was slowly becoming something new — something that would find purpose again.
  </p>
        <br>

  <p>
    The backboard design was an idea that came to me mid-project. I wanted the shelf to feel like a celebration of coffee — not just a storage space, but a <em>functional piece of décor</em>. I found a leftover piece of plywood in my workshop and cut it into the <strong>shape of a steaming coffee cup</strong>, then painted it in a <strong>metallic white</strong> finish. The contrast between the deep mahogany wood and the shimmering background gave the piece a unique personality — rustic and elegant all at once.
  </p>
    <img src="images/shelf.jpg" alt="wood project" class="blog-photo">

  <p>
    The finished shelf measures about <strong>25 inches long</strong>, with enough space to hold <strong>six coffee cups</strong> along the bottom and plenty of room on the top for bags of coffee, syrups, or décor. It’s what I like to call <q>functional décor</q> — a mix of practicality and art that adds warmth to any kitchen or coffee nook.
  </p>
        <br>

  <p>
    The best part, though, is knowing that this creation came from materials that would have otherwise gone to waste. Every knot, grain, and imperfection tells a story of renewal and craftsmanship. I’ve made a few of these shelves for people who fell in love with the design, but the one you see here — this one is mine. It hangs proudly above my <strong>espresso machine</strong>, a daily reminder that creativity can turn the ordinary into something extraordinary.
  </p>
        <br>

  <p>
    I had a lot of fun building this shelf. It’s more than just a woodworking project — it’s a little piece of my love for coffee, design, and the beauty of giving new life to old wood.
